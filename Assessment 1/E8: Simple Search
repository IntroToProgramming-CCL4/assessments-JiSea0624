#Exercise 8: Simple Search - 30 Marks
#Create a command that will notify the user if the name is on the list or not
def search_name (names_list, search_term):
    if search_term in names_list:
        print(f"{search_term} found in the list.")
    #If not, a message will print that the name is not on the list and the command will end 
    else:
        print(f"{search_term} not found in the list.")

#Initiate the list of names
names = ["Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave"]

#Create a variable in which the user will input the name of the person he/she wants to search
search_term = input("Enter the name to search for: ")

#Print the search
search_name(names, search_term)
